1. UART_SV_VERIFICATION
   This project is to test a UART receiver with even parity check. This design was a lab for ECE337 and I added parity check support this summer.
   I am practicing using classes to build testing environment(package, agent, monitor, driver, checker). The old sv testbench I used to test the design is also included(named as tb_rcv_block.sv).
   The uart design specification, block diagram, as well as the test plan can be found in the doc folder.
