## FLEX_COUNTER_SV_VERIFICATION
   - This project is the starting point to learn sv verification. I am practicing using classes to build testing environment(package, agent, monitor, driver, checker). The old sv testbench I used to test the design is also included(named as tb_flex_counter.sv).
## UART_SV_VERIFICATION
   - This project is to test a UART receiver with even parity check.
   - The uart design specification, block diagram, as well as the test plan can be found in the doc folder.
